                <dt>What's my topic?</dt>
                <dd>The site will be about a restaurant in Pacific Beach called Woody's, which is my hangout all summer (and fall and winter and spring! lol) On the site, you can see pics of the restaurant, look at the menu, see images of the food, photos of the staff, and see a table of nutritional information.</dd>
                <dt>Why this topic?</dt>
                <dd>This is a GREAT restaurant and landmark in Pacific Beach!</dd>
                <dt>Who is the audience?</dt>
                <dd>Anyone who wants to know about Woody's food, staff, location, and see user comments will be interested. After viewing my awesome site, visitors will have no choice but to go to Woody's at their first opportunity!
                </dd>
                <dt>What content do I need?</dt>
                <dd>I have a lot of images from Woody's Instagram that may be usable depending on permissions, and also I'm going to take photos of the menu and staff. Some photos will have to be shopped for size and fit
