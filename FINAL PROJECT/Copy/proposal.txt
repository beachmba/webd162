The site will be about a restaurant in PB called Woody's, which is my hangout all summer (and fall and winter and spring!  lol)

Anyone who wants to know about Woody's food, staff, location, and see user comments will be interested.

After viewing my awesome site, visitors will have no choice but to go to Woody's at their first opportunity!

On the site, you can see pics of the restaurant, look at the menu, see images of the food, photos of the staff, and see a table of nutritional information.

Also you can view comments left by other customers

I have a lot of images from Woody's Instagram that may be usable depending on permissions, and also I'm going to take photos of the menu and staff.

Some photos will have to be shopped for size and fit
